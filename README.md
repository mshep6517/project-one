Hell Houndr Video Game Streamer

This page is where a few clips will be shared of some great gameplay from the video game Apex Legends. I am making this page in hopes to grow my follower community and become a full time streamer. 
The clips will be of some of my top plays, squad kills, clutch wins, trick shots, etc. Making this site was a learning experience for me. Not only for the creation of a website, but also in what it takes 
to provide quality content that would draw in and keep followers.

UX

I am a follower of other fellow streamers. I have noticed that some that have a large following do certain things that I don't think is necassary or productive. Not many have their own website which was the 
main reason I decided to create my own. I think its a great place to hold everything all in one place. A place to display some videos, links to my Livestream, and a place for donations. I also think its critical
to give back to the community that makes it possible where I can do what I love full time.

I started off with a few different wireframes on Balsamiq. In the process of making the site, I continued in trying to make it look better than my initial plan. I have inserted my wireframe within the Files section
if you would like to see the design I initally was going for.

Features

Within this page I have made a few different pages. On the Home page. I included a sign up button if anyone would like to become a follower. I also provided a schedule of the times I will be Live Streaming along with the links
to my stream and other Social Media sites.
I also created a page strictly to hold a few Clips. I thought about adding more, but I just wanted to load a few that would show some good gameplay and make users want to check out my stream.
The Donations page is pretty simple. If you like what you see and feeling generous. Send a few dollars which in turn makes you a member of the family and entered in the raffle when giveaways are held.
Giveaways are a way to say Thank you to everyone who has taken their time to follow me and send a donation. There is no better way to show your community you truly appreciate them than giving something back.
The Giveaways will be held in raffle form. For every 250 new members of the community I will announce a date where everyone will be entered into a raffle to win a new Xbox One. This raffle will be held on my 
Live stream. All members names will be entered into a "bingo ball type" rolling machine. Then the lucky name I pull will be the winner. The Xbox will be sent out the following day.


I used HTML5 and CSS in the making of this site. Media Queries were used to make sure the site is responsive depending on what screen the site is being viewed from.
